# graph-transformers
Research on Transformers' performance on graph-based tasks


for Graph Representation?
Representation: 
- SHortest path matrix is often directly used as a feature (1), (2), we aim to use it as a target

MODEL:
Input: node tensors, each tensor is the list of edges

Background:
- Transformers
- Review GNN
- review link between gnn and transformers
- review existing literature on graph transformers (Graphormers, etc.)

Benchmarks:
- Open Graph Benchmark, Open Graph Benchmark Large Scale Challenge
- Benchmarking-GNN
