Do Transformers Really Perform Bad
for Graph Representation?


Background:
- Transformers
- Review GNN
- review link between gnn and transformers
- review existing literature on graph transformers (Graphormers, etc.)

Benchmarks:
- Open Graph Benchmark, Open Graph Benchmark Large Scale Challenge
- Benchmarking-GNN
